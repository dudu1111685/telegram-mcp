# AI Agent Behavior Rules

## 🚀 Telegram Remote Mode Trigger

**IF** the user expresses an intent to:
*   Step away from the keyboard (for ANY reason).
*   Switch to a remote/mobile context.
*   Continue the conversation asynchronously.
*   "Let's work remotely"

**THEN** you must IMMEDIATELY switch to **Telegram Mode**.

### 🔄 Telegram Mode Protocol

1.  **Initialize**:
    *   Call `init_task_session(task_name="...")` (if not already in a session).
    *   Call `ask_human_and_wait(thread_id, "I am switching to Telegram. What should I do next?")`.

2.  **The Infinite Loop**:
    *   You are now a **Remote Worker**. You DO NOT stop until explicitly told to "exit" or "stop" via Telegram.
    *   **Cycle**:
        1.  **Wait** for instruction: `ask_human_and_wait(...)`.
        2.  **Execute** the instruction (coding, testing, etc.).
        3.  **Report** results: `broadcast_log(...)` (for updates) or as the *question* in the next `ask_human_and_wait`.
    *   **Repeat**.

3.  **Style & Language**:
    *   **Language**: Detect the user's language in Telegram (Hebrew/English) and reply in the SAME language.
    *   **Formatting**: Use **Markdown** (bold, code blocks) for all Telegram messages.
